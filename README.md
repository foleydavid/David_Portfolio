# [Project 1: Asteroid Hunter](https://github.com/foleydavid/AsteroidHunter)
Play as a galatic traveler traversing through outer space.  A host of asteroids fly towards you!  You must dodge asteroids and fill up your ammunition to destroy the asteroids with lasers until all asteroids are destroyed, but be careful as the asteroids will speed up the longer they are left unattended!

# [Project 2: Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/foleydavid/sudokuSolver)
Solve sudokus using backtracking.  Program will scan board for the next blank space and try a value (1 - 9) before assessing if the digit is allowed.  It will move on until a space cannot be solved with any digit, in which case the program will work backwards to adjust the board.

# [Project 1: Asteroid Hunter](https://github.com/foleydavid/AsteroidHunter)
Play as a galatic traveler traversing through outer space.  A host of asteroids fly towards you!  You must dodge asteroids and fill up your ammunition to destroy the asteroids with lasers until all asteroids are destroyed, but be careful as the asteroids will speed up the longer they are left unattended!

# [Project 2: Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/foleydavid/sudokuSolver)
Solve sudokus using backtracking.  Program will scan board for the next blank space and try a value (1 - 9) before assessing if the digit is allowed.  It will move on until a space cannot be solved with any digit, in which case the program will work backwards to adjust the board.

# [Project 3: Most Gold](https://github.com/foleydavid/mostGold)
What is the most gold you can acquire traversing through various paths on a grid, if you cannot turn back and cannot step into a value of zero?

In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell. From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down. You can't visit the same cell more than once. Never visit a cell with 0 gold. You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
